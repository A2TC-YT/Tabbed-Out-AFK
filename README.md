# Tabbed-Out-AFK

## About
AFK xp macro for Destiny 2 where you can tab out of the game while its running and use your PC as normal

## How it Works
ViGEmBus is a driver that emulates a PS4 Controller and a Xbox 360 Controller.

The reason this works is because once you alt tab the game becomes unfoucsed and you can't send keyboard and mouse inputs into the game but the game can still aceept controller inputs.

So having ViGEmBus makes it possible to make macros for controllers without owning a controller/needing to pay 600 dollar for a scuff controller to get macros because it just emulates a controller, And thanks to Evilc he made a wrapper so it can be all done through AHK

## How to Install

- How to install VIGEmBus for a emulated controller.
1.Inside the zip file open VIGEmBus folder
2.There should be a exe in there and you should open it and install VIGEmBus
3.Once you have installed everything restart your pc

- How to install AHK Library.
 -  1. Go to AHK Download Directory Normally Default install is at (C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey)
 - 2. Once you have the AHK Directory open in File explorer drag and drop the Lib Folder into the AHK Install Directory

When you have installed everything you can open the Macro folder and start using the afk scripts
