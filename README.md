# Tabbed-Out-AFK

## About

AFK xp macro for Destiny 2 where you can tab out of the game while its running and use your PC as normal

## How it Works

ViGEmBus is a driver that emulates a PS4 Controller or Xbox 360 Controller.
This works because once you alt tab the game becomes unfocused and you can't send keyboard and mouse inputs to the game, however the game can still aceept controller inputs.

So using ViGEmBus makes it possible to make macros for controllers without owning a controller/needing to pay 600 dollar for a scuff controller to get macros. And thanks to Evilc he made a wrapper so it can be all done through AHK

## Installation

How to install VIGEmBus for a emulated controller.

 ㅤ1. Inside the zip file open VIGEmBus folder

 ㅤ2. There should be an exe in there which you need to run to install VIGEmBus

 ㅤ3. Once you have installed everything restart your pc

How to install AHK Library.

  1. Go to AHK Download Directory Normally Default install is at (**C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey**)

  2. Once you have the AHK Directory open in File explorer drag and drop the Lib Folder into the AHK Install Directory

Once everything is installed you can open the Macro folder and start using the afk scripts.
